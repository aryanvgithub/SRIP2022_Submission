I took few readings by placing my finger a little away from the camera,
The readings taken with finger stuck closely to the camera gave better results.

Yes, some readings work better than the others

The possible reason acoording to me could be:
For our video, the camera record the light that comes thorugh our skin directly.
if there is some gap between the camera and finger, light from some other source
may cause interference by adding extra light and distorting the actual ratio of RGB
in the pixels of the frame we need to read accurately.
