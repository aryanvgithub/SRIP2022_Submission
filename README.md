<h3>Task 1:</h>
To solve this task, I traversed through some resarch papers published on the same topic.

One of the resarch paper deeply explained the process and how the algorithm can be implemented
by only using the Redness of each pixel in a frame.

The reference paper has been included in the reference folder of Task1

Implementation of this task took the following steps:
->Converting the video into frames
->Traverseing the frame and find the Red part of each pixel
->The plot of Redness against frames had peaks in it
->These peaks signifies the time at wich your heart pumps the blood
->The duration between two peaks signify the time between two pulses
->Accordingly the algorithmcalculates the Heart Rate

The other details about the Task and how to deploy it are in the "Readme_task1" file under Task1 folder
