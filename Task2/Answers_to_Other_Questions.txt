Peaks:
Each peak has a start point, a top and an end point.

These peaks signify a particular activity like running, walking etc.

The acceleration and de-acceleration is shown by the rise and fall of the peak.

The step size while running, walking etc is different and for the same reason
the peak width is calculated in the code and the multiplier is assigned accordingly
to calculate the distance.
